# API Configuration
# In development: Leave empty or comment out to use Vite proxy (/api -> http://localhost:3001)
# In production: Set to the full URL of your backend API service

# Railway Production Examples:
# Option A - Public URL (Recommended):
# VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend-service.up.railway.app/api
#
# Option B - Railway Internal URL:
# VITE_API_URL=https://backend.railway.internal/api
#
# IMPORTANT: Always include:
# 1. Protocol (https://)
# 2. Full path (/api)
#
# ❌ WRONG: backend.railway.internal
# ✅ CORRECT: https://backend.railway.internal/api
