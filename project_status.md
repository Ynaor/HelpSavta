# Project Status: HelpSavta

## ‚úÖ Recent Fixes Applied (2025-05-30)

### GitHub Workflow Fixes
1. **Security Scan Workflow Removed** ‚úÖ
   - Deleted `.github/workflows/security.yml` completely
   - Reasoning: Not needed for learning project, was causing pipeline failures
   
2. **CI/CD YAML Syntax Fixed** ‚úÖ
   - Fixed line 224 in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
   - Changed `languages: ["javascript", "typescript"]` to `languages: [javascript, typescript]`
   - Reasoning: Incorrect YAML array syntax was preventing pipeline execution

## Current Issues Identified from GitHub Actions Pipeline

### üî¥ Critical Issues (Blocking Deployment)

1. **Code Scanning Not Enabled**
   - Error: "Code scanning is not enabled for this repository"
   - Impact: Security analysis cannot upload results to GitHub
   - Action needed: Enable GitHub Advanced Security features

2. **ESLint Configuration Missing**
   - Error: "ESLint couldn't find a configuration file"
   - Impact: Frontend linting fails, blocking CI pipeline
   - Location: `frontend/` directory
   - Action needed: Create `.eslintrc.js` or similar configuration file

3. **High NPM Audit Vulnerabilities**
   - 6 moderate severity vulnerabilities identified
   - Multiple dependency version conflicts (especially vitest packages)
   - Action needed: Fix vulnerabilities and resolve peer dependency conflicts

### üü° Security Issues (Need Attention)

4. **Dockerfile Security Issues**
   - Backend Dockerfile: Multiple consecutive RUN instructions (2 instances)
   - Frontend Dockerfile: Unpinned apk packages + consecutive RUN instructions
   - Action needed: Consolidate RUN commands and pin package versions

5. **Secret Scanning**
   - Gitleaks scan completed successfully (no secrets found)
   - Status: ‚úÖ PASSED

6. **Infrastructure Security**
   - Trivy scan completed successfully
   - Status: ‚úÖ PASSED

### üü¢ Working Components

- Repository checkout and basic setup
- Node.js setup (v18.20.8)
- Docker builds for security scanning tools
- Azure infrastructure templates scan
- Secret scanning with Gitleaks

## Immediate Action Plan

### Phase 1: Enable Basic CI/CD (Priority 1)

1. **Fix ESLint Configuration**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm init @eslint/config
   # or create manual config
   ```

2. **Resolve NPM Dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm audit fix --force
   # Then manually fix remaining peer dependency conflicts
   ```

3. **Enable GitHub Code Scanning**
   - Go to repository Settings ‚Üí Security & Analysis
   - Enable "Code scanning alerts"
   - Enable "Secret scanning alerts"

### Phase 2: Fix Security Issues (Priority 2)

4. **Fix Dockerfile Issues**
   - Consolidate consecutive RUN commands
   - Pin package versions in frontend Dockerfile
   - Follow Docker best practices

5. **Review and Fix Security Vulnerabilities**
   - Address the 6 moderate severity npm vulnerabilities
   - Update dependencies to secure versions

### Phase 3: Infrastructure Setup (Priority 3)

6. **Azure Resources Setup**
   - Validate Azure Bicep templates
   - Set up Azure Container Registry
   - Configure Azure App Service

7. **Complete CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Fix remaining pipeline issues
   - Test full deployment process

## Current Pipeline Status

| Job | Status | Issues |
|-----|--------|---------|
| Frontend Tests | ‚ùå FAILED | ESLint config missing |
| Security Analysis | ‚ùå FAILED | Code scanning not enabled |
| Secret Scanning | ‚úÖ PASSED | No issues |
| Infrastructure Security | ‚úÖ PASSED | No critical issues |
| Dockerfile Security | ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNINGS | Best practice violations |

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate (Today)**
   - Create ESLint configuration for frontend
   - Enable GitHub Code Scanning in repository settings
   - Fix critical npm vulnerabilities

2. **Short Term (This Week)**
   - Fix Dockerfile security issues
   - Resolve remaining dependency conflicts
   - Test CI pipeline end-to-end

3. **Medium Term (Next Week)**
   - Complete Azure infrastructure setup
   - Implement full deployment pipeline
   - Add monitoring and logging

## Technical Debt

- Frontend dependency management needs cleanup
- Docker images need security hardening
- CI/CD pipeline needs error handling improvements
- Missing proper testing framework setup

## Resources Needed

- GitHub Advanced Security enabled (for code scanning)
- Azure subscription access
- Time to properly configure tooling
